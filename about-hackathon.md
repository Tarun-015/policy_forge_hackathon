README: PolicyForge Hackathon – FRT Regulation
🏷️ Project Title
Safeguarding Identity: A Regulatory Framework for Ethical Use of Facial Recognition in Indian Policing

🧠 Problem Statement
Facial Recognition Technology (FRT) is increasingly used by law enforcement agencies in India for surveillance, crime prevention, and identification. However, its rapid, unregulated deployment poses serious risks related to privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, misuse, and lack of accountability.

Our project proposes a comprehensive governance framework to ensure that FRT, if used in policing, is legally justified, ethically sound, and socially responsible.

🎯 Objective
To draft a policy proposal (max 4 pages) that outlines legal, ethical, technical, and social safeguards for the use of FRT in Indian law enforcement.

📑 Key Focus Areas
⚖️ Legal Boundaries
Define when, where, and how FRT can be used under judicial/administrative approval.

🧾 Transparency & Accountability
Public disclosures, citizen redressal mechanisms, and audit trails.

📊 Bias & Accuracy
Mandatory testing across diverse demographics; public accuracy reporting.

🔐 Data Governance
Time-bound data retention, secure storage, and restricted access.

🧍 Consent & Civil Liberties
Limit use in public spaces; opt-out in semi-public zones; signage for public awareness.

🛠️ Our Approach
Referenced AI governance workshop principles (ethics, privacy, social impact).

Adopted a tiered framework for regulating high-risk vs low-risk FRT uses.

Benchmarked against global standards (EU AI Act, Puttaswamy Judgment, etc.).

Suggested a regulatory sandbox for controlled testing of FRT models in India.
